1	B00000JNHJ	Great game, I dont really think its a little kid game...im 14 and i still think its tough.The controls are very hard to get used to.Besides the goofy storyline and tough controls, its still an awesome game.
2	B000035XYC	you create things.That's about it.You also fight these little flying lizard-things that pour our of a hole in the ground until you build a building over it.This game will keep you entertained for about an hour,then it gets boring quickly.My advice is to rent the game before buying it.
3	B0000296ZD	The improvements of the graphics are very good, quake engines are always constructed well in sounds and graphics, being a reason of buying a new graphic card most of the time.  But this time, in terms of playability, it wasn't quite a succes for Quake.  I don't have any complaints about the lack of the single player mode, I play quake multiplayer most of the time.  Bots are ok, if you want to play in single.  The problem is quake 3 turns out to be a game that rookies have more advantage.  It is easier to frag than quake and quake II, and I don't get the same quake pleasure I used to get.  It is not a bad game.  Even a good one for somebody new to multiplayer first person shooters, but for an experienced player, it is a disillusionment.  I'll continue to play quake2 and counterstrike, but when I'm in need of some more blood, it is still a good game.
4	B00009WDLD	The graphics in this game aren't all that much of an improvement, but the game is incredibly choppy. Did Eidos use the UT2003 enging? I doubt it. I'm saving up to buy the GeForce FX 5700 Ultra, so Deus Ex 2 had better not be choppy at all. I've got a fast pc with a gig of PC3200 ram, so when I buy and install the 5700 Ultra, I'd better see 30 fps or more, or there is something seriously wrong with this game's engine.
5	B00009TW6R	This is a horrible game, average graphics, bad controls,and unrealistic. ex. when you sniper someone it leaves a white trail on bullet, i thought snipering was being covert not on this game! overall a bad 1st person shooter.
6	B00000K4MC	I never thought this game looked very good until I played it at a friend's house.  I went out and bought it for the very low price of under ten bucks at Wal*Mart the next day.It is so much fun!  You can build and design your own rides, or buy ones that have already been built.  Food stands, bathrooms, and souvenier stands can also be purchased as well as scenery items.  Detailed information is available about all of your customers, from their feelings to how much money they're willing to spend at your park.  You have a certain goal to reach when you create a theme park, and when you reach it, your name will be posted under the location name.  And there are many new locations to unlock as well.  You can hire handymen to clean up trash and puke, mechanics to fix and check rides, security guards to make sure no one breaks anything, and entertainers that can be dressed in a panda, tiger, or elephant suit.  Also, some advice: Don't let your park entrance fee be "FREE" (If you start at $1.00, people will keep saying that your entrance fee is cheap, and you get to raise it!  I got as high as $20 once!)Overall, if you like The Sims, or Zoo Tycoon, you will enjoy this game!  It is addicting, and is now a favorite of mine!  I'm so happy I gave it a chance.
7	B00000DMAV	The original Grand Theft Auto was a classic for the PC, but it's gleefully unabashed violence, simple graphics, dark humor, and addictive gameplay garnered the game much appeal and controversy.  Eventually Take 2 Interactive (now they're called Rockstar) published GTA on as many systems as it could: the PS1, Dreamcast, and even the Game Boy Color.  These days anyone and everyone are GTA nuts, but only when it comes to GTA 3 or Vice City.  The original GTA may seem simple enough, but it is undeniably fun for the most part, no matter how simplistic the graphics seem.  The missions can get rather tedious, and the fact you can't save your progress in game (a problem which would be corrected in GTA 3), and eventually you'll lose interest, but for the most part the original GTA is still loads of fun.  Those who have only played GTA 3 or Vice City will not like this original installment, but it's a great ride while it lasts.
8	B00008URUB	Sonic Adventure DX is supposed to be a nearly identical copy of the Sega Dreamcast title, Sonic Adventure, but something drastic has been lost in its translation to the GameCube.  This game is severely lacking the feel of its Dreamcast version and, on top of that, it seems to be full of glitches.The first flaw most players will notice are the very akward camera angles.  In this version of the game, players have very little control over the game's camera and, as a result, will often have their characters suffer death from an unseen enemy or pit.The second flaw players will likely notice are the glitches in the game's platforms.  While progressing through certain levels, players can suddenly find their characters falling through floors and walls that *should* be solid and impermeable.  (The passability glitches in the floors and walls always occur in the same places, so players *can* avoid them once learning where they are.)If you are willing to deal with the frustration of frequent, random character death, then you might find this game to be a lot of fun.  Otherwise, you should probably avoid it and find a good platform title elsewhere.
9	B00000DMB3	I have played many many many video games in my life, and this game is literally the best game that I have ever played in my life. It's nice and long (like all the other Zelda games) It has a perfect level of difficulty, there are so many different weapons in the game, there are so many memorable dungeons and fields in the game, well, I could go on forever. I wish I could give this game a higher score than the measly 5-star rating Amazon.com forces me to give but alas, i cannot. If you own a Nintendo 64, BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW! If you don't own an N64, you can still buy it for gamecube, it's the same exact game. I own it for both N64 and Gamecube. If you like this game, then buy the sequel too! It's called Majora's mask. I'm telling you, you will definetly not regret buying this game if you are a die-hard Zelda fan... Or even if you are not a die-hard Zelda fan. Although I don't know who would be reading a review of a game that was made in nineteen ninety-something, in 2007... IF YOU ARE READING THIS, BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, AND IF YOU DON'T YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!  Everything about this game is perfect!... That is all.
10	B00002CF9M	Lord Of TerrorWhen Diablo came out almost 4 years ago, it was the surprise hit of the 1997. One day there wasn't Diablo, the next it was on store shelves, and the day after North American productivity plummeted 25%. Although Blizzard liked to classify it as a RPG, it wasn't really one. More like an action-RPG, since so much of the game relied on reflex and mouse-clicking. The story development was slim and roleplaying aspects non-existent. Yet the simple, addictive gameplay hooked us all and had us begging for more.After years of development, a few promises, a few leaked features and dozens of delays - Diablo II is here. The Second Coming of Hell and another dip in all IT stocks came to my desk less than a week ago, and grudgingly I accepted the job of reviewing the game.For those of you who've been in a timewarp the past 5 years and never heard of Diablo or Diablo II, let me give you a brief rundown on both.DiabloDiablo was a game where you played a hero of one of three character classes - Warrior, Sorcerer or Rogue. This hero operated out of a small town called Tristram, underneath which Hell itself was opening up. At first simply trying to clear the local corrupted Cathedral of vermin infestation, the hero soon discovers that something much more sinister is afoot. Hence you keep going deeper and deeper through the game until you discover that none other than the Lord of Terror himself - Diablo - is at the root of all the problems. You see, he, along with his two other brothers - form the Three Prime Evils. They got banished from Hell by lesser evils and then rampaged around the world until they were captured in soulstones given to mortals by the angel Tyrael.Through 4 different dungeons having 4 levels each you fought, died, and recovered your own corpse. You'd restart the game when it got too hard to gain xp in easier areas, and go back in again. It was all about getting to the next level, getting the next spell, getting the next better weapon or armor. It was simple to the point of being idiotic. Click the mouse to move somewhere, then click-click-click-click-click at some monster until it dies, and move on to kill more. That's an over-simplified description, of course - but the point is that Diablo was extremely addictive.
11	B00000DMAT	Goldeneye lookes like just another shootem up game, but it is more than that. Goldeneye takes James Bond to the next level.Pros: graphics are great4 player is funlots of cheats to make the game even betteralot of characters to choose fromCons: a little to easy to beatno voices during game playnot alot of multiplayer levelsIn the end Goldeneye is a great game and I recommend it to anyone.
12	B00005NZ1G	What is the big deal about Halo. It is one of the worst and stupidest games I have ever played. I think people like it because all you do is kill aliens that are extreamly stupid. In one mission you can kill like 100 alien things and you die 4 times. The aliens even speak english. How would a thing billions of miles away from earth know how to speak english. I think that is just stupid. Theres only like 10 weapons and 4 things you can ride in in the game.  In the game the warthog and earth cars can never break or explode but the alien stuff can. Another stupid thing is the missions are way too long. It takes abouut 1 hour to finish a mission. And once you die you come back to life. So anyone can beat the game. Some aleins have invisible shields on them and you have to waste a lot of ammo on them. All you can carry is two guns and grenades. And since theres only like 10 weapons you allways pick up the same gun. Theres only about 8 differnent kinds of aliens and they are all stupid. Hunters are big alien things that are almost impossible to kill, little stupid aliens that speak english and run away from you, little aliens with shields, big aliens that have invisible shields around them and they chase you, Floods that when you kill them little ball thing with no guns come out and jump and pop on you, theres more but they are mainly the same as the ones I just wrote but they are different colors or are bigger or smaller. If you like combat games dont buy this because all you do is kill dumb aleins. It is not hard at all. Dont buy it.
13	B00000I1BE	Now if you are a fan or those 2-D games and stuff like that, you probably will think this is a disgrace for the N64. I thought this game was awesome. Especially the beginning, Forest Of Silence! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good. The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge, get this. I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels, (I'm not sure of this) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure. I thought the game could have been a little more...well....diverse and detailed, but where I am now, is awesome! I have to say, I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much. I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard. Really, I just didn't put my mind to it and look where I am now. I'm in the 1st castle! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours. I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes. There isn't much of a story to this game but for me, that's okay. But for serious gamers (I think I am but this game is so good that I don't really care about the story) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story. There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time. The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out (no cheats no guide no nothing). There are two charaters to chose from. Reinhart and a girl (I forgot her name). Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things. I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon. The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up. I don't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you, you have to charge. She also has these two....rings they look like. She uses that to slice things, just like Reinhart's sword. There are two modes you can go through. Easy and Normal. Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy. There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff. As I mentioned before, their isn't much of a storyline but when you start the game, there is some. So that makes the game better. Be prepared to do a lot of jumping.Overall, this game has great sound effects, music, weapons, items, charaters, abilities, an okay storyline, excellent graphics and just a really good play!
14	B00005NCCA	I have all the Spyro games for PS1 & PS2, and I LOVE them, so when I got my GBA I bought Season Of Ice right away....and was very annoyed.  At first I thought it would be cool, because there are fairies and mermaids, but the controls are much more difficult on the GBA than the Playstations.  I have trouble getting Spyro to go the direction I want him to, especially on diagonals.  I think it's because you're using directional buttons instead of a joystick.  I don't think it can be the fault of the button on my individual GBA, because I bought it brand new and this is one of the first games I've played on it.  Anyway, I have trouble crossing bridges and just moving around in general; it makes it incredibly obnoxious, because every time you fall in water you die.  I say, if you have a Game Cube and a Game Boy Player (so you can use a joystick) this could be a great game, but if you just have a GBA, don't bother, it's more frustrating than it's worth.
15	B0000TSR4C	This game was definately not worth the hype (If there was any). I remember seeing a commercial for it and I was thinking "GTA ripoff" and it pretty much is. GTA is alot better than this in everything, this game was to bland. I got bored with this really, really quick.
16	B0000AFWWH	I bought Myst Anniversary Edition for my son, who loves puzzles. Unfortunately, all I get is a black screen with a hand and no option but to kill the window. As it turns out, you have to downgrade Quicktime to an old version to make it work. If you do, you can't run Itunes.Don't buy the game.  Sorry, there will be other games, this one's a ripoff.
17	B00001P4QN	I have only played flight sim games on pc and was really surprised to discover this great game on dreamcast. It's an old game which is almost a decade old, but i had to test my flight joystick(Panther). I had a problem loading the game because i bought it from ebay for $6 with some scratches. After i got past the main screen i had a choice of planes to purchase, but since i had no money which you get for shooting down enemies, i had to pick my default plane.I have completed the first couple of missions in about an hour because i picked the easiest setting. But about half was through the game i started having difficulty completing some missions because of time limit and more enemies.  I finally got enough money to buy a descent plane and none of the enemy planes could touch me.There are escort missions,protect the target, and take out an enemy objectives.  The real challenge came during the last two levels which i had to restart numerous times and by that time i could afford to buy most of all the planes. There are different variety of enemies such as ground,sea, and air. But the most challenging is the air targets, especially when you have to chase them and you have limited amount of time.I was using a Panther flight stick and didn't have a chance yet to try standard controller. The flight stick was awesome, it responded quickly and all buttons have its own distinct function. I would recommend playing this game with a flight stick, if you can find it.  It  just feels like you're in the game when using the joystick.The graphics are as you expect on console made in 1999, pixalated in some parts. The plane detail is pretty good for a console flight sim and looks very similar to real plane. The ground texture look good from above, but really pixalated when close.This game is on Dreamcast,so don't expect a real flight sim, this is just an arcade port. You can buy this game on Ebay or Amazon for under $10. Just have fun.
18	B00002R28C	This is a must buy for any RPG fans! Two of the greatest games ever released together relatively cheap! It's a dream come true!Firstly, Final Fantasy V. It is doubtlessly better than the first four.The graphics, sound and storyline are far superior. The characters have better personalities than the first four. Basically you take command of this guy called Butz who is travelling around the world on his chocobo. The wind begins to weaken and you and some friends are given the task of protecting the crystals which basically control the world. This is an enjoyable game and I recommend you play this one first because FF6 is so much better. If you play that first then FF5 will be a let down.FF6 is probably the greatest ever RPG. Forget the dodgy graphics and sound. This game has the best storyline and characters out of any FF game. It also includes the best villain in any game ever! Kefka, the psychopathic, twisted general! I won't give away too much about the storyline because it will spoil it.JUST GET IT!!!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
19	B00009WAVB	This game is just all right.  We enjoy playing it on 4 player &amp; teaming up.  I wish there was an option for auto target or an option to see your man but there's not.  The boards are a lot smaller on multiplayer.  I think this is a good game to rent but don't recommend purchasing it.
20	B00005V6BI	If you liked Duke Nukem, or other run-and-grab-stuff kind of games, sure, this might be for you.I was looking for more of an RPG experience.The ship fighting is a little confusing when you first start, and I never got past the first level.
